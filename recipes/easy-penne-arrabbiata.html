    <!-- Description -->
    <h2>What is Arrabbiata?</h2>
    <p>
      Arrabbiata is a spicy, tomato-based sauce that originated in the Lazio
      region of Italy (near Rome). It’s most commonly served with penne pasta as
      a dish called penne all’arrabbiata. And while the word arrabbiata means
      “angry” in Italian, eating pasta made with this sauce will make you
      anything but angry! Instead, it’s a reference to the spiciness of the
      sauce.

      Our version strays a bit from the traditional with the additions of maple
      syrup and vegan parmesan cheese. It’s balanced and full of flavor yet made
      with easily accessible ingredients. For a more authentic version of the
      dish, check out this recipe from the lovely Ciao Florentina blog.

    <!-- Ingredients -->
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Pasta</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Water for boiling</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp salt (for seasoning the water)</li>
      <li>
        10-12 ounces pasta of choice (penne is best // gluten-free as needed)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 Tbsp olive oil, plus more for finishing (if oil-free, sub water and
        add more as needed as it evaporates)
      </li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2-3 tsp crushed red pepper flakes*, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>3 Tbsp tomato paste* (organic, high quality when possible)</li>
      <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes (we prefer Pomi or San Marzano)</li>
      <li>3 healthy pinches sea salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>2-3 tsp maple syrup, plus more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Steps -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil for the pasta.</li>
      <li>
        Heat a large rimmed skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Once hot, add
        olive oil, minced garlic, and crushed red pepper flake (for milder
        spice, start with the lesser quantity — for a serious kick, go with the
        full amount!). Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, and watching
        carefully not to let it burn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add tomato paste and stir into the garlic and red pepper flake (a spoon
        or rubber spatula works best). Cook until fragrant and the tomato paste
        has darkened slightly — ~2-3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add crushed tomatoes, salt, and maple syrup and stir. Bring to a very
        low simmer. Cook, covered, for 20-30 minutes, or until the sauce has
        reduced slightly and the flavors are deepened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt to taste, red pepper
        flake for heat, or maple syrup for sweetness / to balance the spice. A
        bit more tomato paste can be added for depth of flavor, but a little
        goes a long way. And if the flavors aren’t quite developed, simmer for
        just a bit longer (covered) to allow the flavors to deepen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, when the water in the pot boils, add the pasta and stir to
        prevent clumps. Cook to al dente according to the package instructions.
        Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water then drain the pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and stir to coat. If your sauce looks
        too thick, add pasta water 2 tablespoons at a time until you have a
        silky sauce that clings to the noodles. You likely won’t need all of the
        reserved pasta water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve as is or garnished with vegan parmesan cheese and fresh basil.
        Extra red pepper flakes on top add additional heat and a pop of color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days, though best
        when fresh. Sauce is freezer friendly (when stored separate from the
        pasta) for up to 2 months. Reheat pasta on the stovetop, adding a bit of
        water to thin as needed.
